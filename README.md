#### Plotly Challenge
### Belly Button Biodiversity

A dataset containing biodiversity data taken from a number of test subjects. The resulting analysis on the bacteria found in the test swabs is presented in the dashboard located at https://coreymcculley.github.io/plotly-challenge/. 

For each test subject the dashboard presents their:
  - Demographic information
  - A bar chart of the top 10 OTUs found in the swab analysis
  - A bubble chart detailing all the samples taken
  - A gauge chart showing the number of times the test subject washes their belly button each week

Users can select which test subject they want to investigate using the drop down menu at the top left below the jumbotron header.
